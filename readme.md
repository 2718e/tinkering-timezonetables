## Time zone Tables

(Originally a toy project made because wanted to see how offline web apps worked, 
abandoned for years now considering trying to at least update it enough to resolve security warnings)

Goal of this project is to create a small web app that provides an easy way to answer the question

"When it is time T in location X, what time will it be in location Y"

(for example when it is 8am in London, what is the time in Australia?)

Also want to make the app work without an internet connection (via service workers)

### Status

project shouldn't be used until security alerts can be fixed, taken down deployments

### Roadmap

Current todos

- update packages (if possible) to resolve dependabot alerts.
