How to allow user to select timezone.

typing cumbersome on mobile but the list is quite big so maybe dont want a drop down with nearly 600 items

maybe region then city? (split zone name on the / character, have a dropdown for region then city, city dropdown populated by filter on region.)

for now just use the react select component

need to have
- prettier table
- more user control over ordering (i.e. choosing what is the base zone)

Why is webpack-dev-server only looking for webpack.config.js and not for webpack.dev.js (apparently) - probably need a command switch

Should the selected date actually be persisted or not? or should we just default to now each load or have a set to now button

Looking more closely bug with keys in react select may be to do with 

If persisting local storage, what about migrating / schema change

Since there is not a lot of user data being saved is this even necessary
- could still get bugs if a missing key though
- so need a way to detect if the data is out of date even if just want to throw it away and not migrate...
