How to allow user to select timezone.

typing cumbersome on mobile but the list is quite big so maybe dont want a drop down with nearly 600 items

maybe region then city? (split zone name on the / character, have a dropdown for region then city, city dropdown populated by filter on region.)

_________________________

for now just use the react select component

need to have
- prettier table
- more user control over ordering (i.e. choosing what is the base zone)

Why is webpack-dev-server only looking for webpack.config.js and not for webpack.dev.js (apparently) - probably need a command switch

Should the selected date actually be persisted or not? or should we just default to now each load or have a set to now button
